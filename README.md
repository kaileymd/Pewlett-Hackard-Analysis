# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
In preparation for the advancing age of the baby boomer generation, Pewlett Hackard (PH) is developing a new program for retiring employees. Rather than retiring, eligible employees would be retained as part-time employees to educate and mentor their successors. As part of the development process, this SQL program answers how many upcoming retirees this would impact as well as who is eligible to participate in the mentorship program as a successor.

### Results
.insert boomers retiring. insert eligible mentees numbers

### Summary
When considering the retirement of baby boomers and the implementation of the mentorship program, PH should consider:
- About 90,000 of their 300,000 total employees are retiring - that's 30% of their workforce.
- According to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/24/baby-boomers-us-labor-force/) many baby boomers are choosing to stay in the labor force longer than previous generations. This increases the odds that the actual retirement rate PH will see will be lower than what this analysis has indicated.
- Barring their personal choices, the amount of individuals retiring each year is consistent: DOB PIC
- The number of retirees vs. mentees. When looking at the two most populous titles - Senior Engineer and Senior Staff - there is a clear mismatch between the group sizes for those retiring compared to those they would be mentoring. 
  - For example, 29,414 Senior Engineers are retiring, while only 529 are eligible for the mentorship. PH's mentor position needs would be filled if only 2% of retirees join the program.

### Conclusion
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  - 90,398
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  - Yes, but there are not enough employees eligible for the mentorship program to replace them. PH should consider expanding their eligibility requirements or outside hiring to bridge the gap as it becomes necessary, particularly as none of their employees were born after 1965: <all emp dob pic
